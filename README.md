# Welcome

I created this repository because I have more ideas for iOS apps than I have time and appetite to execute on them and bring them to App Store. So I decided to at least share those.

Some ideas are purely textual, for some I created simple concept images which are included. Some ideas are likely very bad and don't make sense or are already implemented.

**Feel free to use any idea, concept** to create new app and launch it in the AppStore. No attribution required, however I would love to see how the ideas look as finished app.

Get in touch on Twitter - [@nemecek_f](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f) to discuss ideas below, some other ideas or just chat :-)

## Ideas (so far)

_Hope to add more in the future_. Started ordering from Newest to Oldest since March 2022.

- **Route Tracker** - Track routes while walking without any health stuff. Main use case to visualize your most frequent routes in the cities you live or when visiting new city, you would be able to see after a day or two the places you haven't walked through yet.

- **Photo Relive AR** - Use ARKit to "relive" past pictures on the same spots you initially took them. So perhaps the initial screen would be map view with photos took near and then on the same spot, you would turn on the camera and use some "magic" to find the exact spot in 3D place and use ARKit to place vertical plane with the picture on the same spot.


- **Contact share** - Quickly share single contact with someone using a QR code. The app would first present built-in contact picker to select contact and then you could select which fields to share (perhaps you want to share just person's name and email, not phone number). Generated QR code would then be shown on the display.


- **[Animal Units Converter](Animal-Units-Converter.md)** _[concept image]_ - convert weight to üêò, ü¶ì and more

- [Auto Meme with Vision](Auto-Meme-with-Vision.md) - use powerful `Vision` framework to streamline the meme process

- [Coupons tracker](Coupons-tracker.md) _[concept image]_ - track all discount coupons with useful features


- [Friend finder](friend-finder.md) - use the new `NearbyInteraction` to let users find their friends in crowds

- [FitLock](fit-lock.md) - app that locks features/app until you exercise

- [Image Compressor for sharing](Image-Compressor-for-Sharing.md) - allow users to quickly compress image before sending to save data plan

- [Practical Color Picker](practical-color-picker.md) - picking colors with HSL with context for better experience

- [Photos organizer](photos-organizer.md) - easy and quick wait to organize photos into albums

- [PrivateCam](private-cam.md) - private camera and photo album

- **Haptic timer** - for people presenting. The app could emit light haptic every 5 minutes for example to help with pacing and then strong one when time is almost out. 
 
- [Sharing photos to Apple TV](Image-Sharing-to-Apple-TV.md) - let users easily share photos to Apple TV, the current AirPlay solution in iOS is cumbersome

- **Short Shower** - app that automatically tracks your time in shower analyzing the sound. With current Machine Learning APIs this could be done on-device. The goal is to encourage less water use by making people conscious of the time they spend showering

- **[Timelapse from photos](Loong-timelapse.md)**  _[concept image]_ - let user create video timelapse from pictures so the timelapse isnt constrained to single recording

- [Timezone based reminders](Timezone-reminders.md) - for better remote work experience

- [Tooth Watch](Tooth-Watch.md) - watchOS app for better teeth brushing

- [Trip Helper](Trip-helper.md) - never forget stuff to pack for travel

- [Universal Links Checker](universal-links-checker.md) - automate universal links validation

- [Watch Notes](Watch-Notes.md) _[concept image]_ - important notes always on your wrist

- **Watch Measure** - With iOS 15 and watchOS 8 it should be possible to get distance between your phone and Watch. With this app, you would place your phone on a point A, walked over to point B and see the distance on your Watch.

- [Yoga/fitness](Yoga-fitness.md) - use the new `Vision` APIs in iOS 14 to help people exercise correctly.
