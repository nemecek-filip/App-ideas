# App Ideas

### Collection of ideas for iOS apps that I don't plan to build (probably)..

# Welcome

I created this repository because I have more ideas for iOS apps than I have time and appetite to execute on them and bring them to AppStore. So I decided to at least share those.

Some ideas are purely textual, for some I created simple concept images which are included. Some ideas are likely very bad and don't make sense or are already implemented.

**Feel free to use any idea, concept** to create new app and launch it in the AppStore. No attribution required, however I would love to see how the ideas look as finished app.

Get in touch on Twitter - [@nemecek_f](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f) to discuss ideas below, some other ideas or just chat :-)

## Ideas (so far)

_Hope to add more in the future_

- **[Animal Units Converter](Animal-Units-Converter.md)** _[concept image]_ - convert weight to üêò, ü¶ì and more

- [Auto Meme with Vision](Auto-Meme-with-Vision.md) - use powerful `Vision` framework to streamline the meme process

- [Coupons tracker](Coupons-tracker.md) _[concept image]_ - track all discount coupons with useful features

- [Friend finder](friend-finder.md) - use the new `NearbyInteraction` to let users find their friends in crowds

- [FitLock](fit-lock.md) - app that locks features/app until you exercise

- [Image Compressor for sharing](Image-Compressor-for-Sharing.md) - allow users to quickly compress image before sending to save data plan

- [Practical Color Picker](practical-color-picker.md) - picking colors with HSL with context for better experience

- [Photos organizer](photos-organizer.md) - easy and quick wait to organize photos into albums

- [PrivateCam](private-cam.md) - private camera and photo album

- **Haptic timer** - for people presenting. The app could emit light haptic every 5 minutes for example to help with pacing and then strong one when time is almost out. 
 
- [Sharing photos to Apple TV](Image-Sharing-to-Apple-TV.md) - let users easily share photos to Apple TV, the current AirPlay solution in iOS is cumbersome

- **Short Shower** - app that automatically tracks your time in shower analyzing the sound. With current Machine Learning APIs this could be done on-device. The goal is to encourage less water use by making people conscious of the time they spend showering

- **[Timelapse from photos](Loong-timelapse.md)**  _[concept image]_ - let user create video timelapse from pictures so the timelapse isnt constrained to single recording

- [Timezone based reminders](Timezone-reminders.md) - for better remote work experience

- [Tooth Watch](Tooth-Watch.md) - watchOS app for better teeth brushing

- [Trip Helper](Trip-helper.md) - never forget stuff to pack for travel

- [Universal Links Checker](universal-links-checker.md) - automate universal links validation

- [Watch Notes](Watch-Notes.md) _[concept image]_ - important notes always on your wrist

- **Watch Measure** - With iOS 15 and watchOS 8 it should be possible to get distance between your phone and Watch. With this app, you would place your phone on a point A, walked over to point B and see the distance on your Watch.

- [Yoga/fitness](Yoga-fitness.md) - use the new `Vision` APIs in iOS 14 to help people exercise correctly.
