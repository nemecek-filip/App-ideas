# Trip Helper - never forget anything when travelling

## This is really simple and straightforward app.

### First step for the user would be to define trips (like short one, weekly trip, monthly maybe?) and then list items that are must have for any given trip.

### The app would then create new to-do list based on the selected trip and the items added to it.

You could of course achieve this by creating "template" trip in smarter to-do apps and then duplicating the list and checking items, but I think this is much neater and could allow for more helpful features.
